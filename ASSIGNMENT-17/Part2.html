      <div class="d1">
        Havanese (a bichon type dog) is the national dog of Cuba, developed from the now extinct Blanquito de la Habana ("little white dog of Havana"). The Blanquito descended from the also now-extinct Bichón Tenerife. It is believed that the Blanquito was eventually cross-bred with other bichon types, including the poodle, to create what is now known as the Havanese. Sometimes referred to as "Havana Silk Dogs", this was originally another name for the Blanquito de la Habana.

        The Havanese is small in size and sturdy in structure with a tail carried over its back and ears that drop and fold. The coat is abundant, long, and silky, and comes in all colors.[1] The Havanese has a spirited personality and a curious disposition, and is notable for its springy gait,

        , a characteristic that distinguishes the breed from all others.[3] The Havanese is considered an ideal family pet and a true companion dog.[1] They are highly adaptable to almost any environment.
      </div><br />
        <div class="d4">
        Because of their strong social needs, Havanese will not thrive in an environment where they are isolated for several hours each day.

          <h3 class="h31">characteristic</h3>
      <div class="d1">
        Though it is a toy dog,[1] Havanese are sturdy and not overly delicate. Most are 10 to 16 lb (4.5 to 7.3 kg) and 8 1⁄2 to 11 1⁄2 in (22 to 29 cm), with the ideal being 9 to 10 1⁄2 in (23 to 27 cm) at the withers. The body, measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks, is slightly longer than the height at the withers, giving the dog the appearance of being slightly longer than tall. The length of the body results from the long ribcage, not the loins.
      </div><br />
        <div class="d2">
        A unique aspect of the breed is the topline, which rises just slightly from withers to croup, creating a topline that is straight but not level. Renowned for their flashy, lively gait, when on the move, their strong rear drive and slightly shorter upper arm produce a springy motion rather than a far-reaching one. The angle of the topline does not change while moving at a natural gait.
      </div><br />
        <div class="d3">
        The muzzle is full and tapers slightly at the nose. It does not have the appearance of being short or snipy. Length of skull measured from stop to point of occiput is equal to the length of muzzle. The top of the skull is rather flat and the back skull is rounded

        <div class="d4">
        The Havanese has dark brown eyes and almond-shaped lids surrounded by black pigment. The ears, when extended, reach half way to the nose. They arc slightly upward at the base and hang down on the sides of the head without touching the face. The tail is carried arched forward up over the back. While the tail's long plume of hair falls on th

      <h3 class="h3">Coat and Colour</h3>
      <div class="d1">
        The coat is long, soft, lightweight, and silky. The Havanese coat is slightly wavy, profuse, and undulating. Unlike other double-coated breeds, the Havanese outer coat is neither coarse nor overly dense, but rather soft and light. The undercoat is sometimes completely absent. The Havanese coat should be very soft, almost cool to the touch, like unrefined silk (compared to the Maltese coat, which feels like refined silk). However, in some dogs the coat can become too silky, looking oily. On the other end of the spectrum, Havanese coats can be too harsh or cottony, giving a frizzy appearance.
      </div><br />
      
       <div class="d2">
        Because of the tropical nature of the Havanese, the fine and lightweight coat is designed to act as a sunshade and cooling agent on hot days. This means that, though the coat is abundant and may appear warm, the Havanese must be protected from the cold. These dogs become cold very easily so keeping their coat longer in winter time is essential, especially since these dogs originate from hot weather.
      </div><br />
      
       <div class="d3">
        The coat is shown naturally brushed out, or in some countries it may be corded, a technique which turns the long coat into cords of hair, similar to dreadlocks in humans. This corded look may be difficult to achieve for the first timer, so it is always recommended that someone interested in cording their Havanese consults someone who has done it before. Brushing out their fur is essential. This breed's fur grows very fast and without brushing it, the fur can become tangled easily. Also, even though this breed is hypoallergenic, Havanese have hair that doesn't fall off (shed) but it still needs to be groomed.
      </div><br />
       <div class="d4">
        Although there are a few arguments on whether the original Havanese were all white or of different colors, modern Havanese are acceptable in all coat colors and patterns. All colored dogs should have a black nose and black pigment around the eyes, with the exception of chocolate (brown) dogs, which may have dark brown pigment on their nose instead. Examples of coat colors are white, cream, fawn, red, chocolate brown, beige, gold, silver, blue, and black. The coat may be one solid color or have markings in one or more other colors. For example, sable, brindle

     <h3 class="h31" >Temperament</h3>
     <div class="d1">
        The Havanese becomes very attached and are very loyal to their owners, often attaching to one person especially whom they will closely follow.[4] The Havanese is not suited to be alone all day. Although the Havanese is an active and lively dog, it is small enough that much of its exercise needs can be met in a house or yard, and it therefore does not require as much vigorous exercise as other breeds. However, exercise is still necessary for this breed to be happy and healthy.[1]
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="d2">
        The Havanese is satisfied when their owner is satisfied. They are very friendly dogs and do not typically bark at strangers, but some individuals are more shy than others. The Havanese is not a yappy dog,[4] but it will alert its owners to approaching people. Usually acknowledging that you have heard their alert is enough to make them cease. Some have strong attachment issues, known by their owners as velcro dogs, following household members everywhere

      <div class="d3">
        They are good with children. They love to perform in front of others and have a great need for affection. This breed is not afraid to show affection[1] and loves getting attention. They manage well with people of all ages and can thrive in any size home.[4]

        <div class="d1">
          The profuse coat needs to be thoroughly combed at least twice per week. A Havanese with a dense or curly coat will be more prone to tangling and matting, thus requiring more frequent combing, than one with a silky, slightly wavy coat. If not showing the dog, it can be trimmed shorter to require less brushing. Many pet owners clip their dogs into a 1–2 inch long "puppy cut" for ease of maintenance. When owners give them a bath, they must make sure to dry them. Some in shorter clips can blot and air dry, but most will need to be blown dry. Owners can also comb their hair out after bathing so as not to dry in mats. Use high air but low heat to protect their sensitive skin.

        <div class="d2">
          Hair that grows on the bottom of their feet between the paw-pads needs trimming to allow traction on smooth floors. If they go out in the snow, ice clumps will stick between their paw pads, which can be rinsed off in warm water or protected against with booties.
        </div><br />
        <div class="d3">
          Some develop tear staining. A veterinarian might suggest treating red yeast issues to help diminish or eliminate staining; sometimes diet allergens are to blame and switching to a food without common allergens can be helpful. Excess tearing is sometimes a result of hair getting into the eyes; it is recommended that hair below eyes be allowed to grow out instead of shaved out. Havanese can wear a topknot or small braids to keep the hair out of their eyes during everyday activities.

        <div class="d4">
          As with any dog with dropped ears, the ears must be kept clean to help prevent ear infections. A cotton ball can be placed just inside each ear before bathing to prevent excess water from entering in. After bathing, since it may be moist, pluck a few hairs inside the dog's ears to let air circulate through, preventing fungus from building
